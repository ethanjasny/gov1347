For my last blog post until my final prediction, I’m going to construct a pooled district-level model to predict Democratic vote share based on the demographics of the districts. It became clear that a pooled model — rather than 435 distinct models for each district — would be necessary to predict district-level results.</description>

The main focus of my blog this week will be transferring my linear model to a probabilistic model. I’ll thus complete blog extension three as I create a binomial logistic regression model for every congressional district in the country.</description>

      <description>This blog is an ongoing assignment for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor Ryan Enos. It will be updated weekly and culminate in a predictive model of the 2022 midterm elections.
This week, I’ll be trying to answer one central question: does advertising in midterm elections predict the results of congressional elections? As we don’t yet have access to 2022 advertising data, I won’t be able to make a prediction for 2022 districts.</description>

This week, I’ll focus on the value of expert predictions and incumbency in building my model for the 2022 midterms. First, I’ll analyze the accuracy of experts in predicting the 2018 midterm elections, completing blog extensions 1 and 2.</description>

In this week’s blog, I will be incorporating polling into my predictive modeling. I will create predictions using polling in two ways. First, I’ll update a version of my economic fundamentals model from last week with polling data.</description>

“It’s the economy, stupid,” became a slogan of Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. With the nation facing recession under incumbent President George H.W. Bush, political strategist James Carville coined the phrase to keep the campaign focused on the big picture.</description>
